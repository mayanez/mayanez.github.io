Until recently, I was part of the [CASTL]({{ site.castlurl }}) Lab and advised by [Prof. Simha Sethumadhavan]({{ site.simhaurl}}) at <a class="columbia-font" href="http://www.cs.columbia.edu">Columbia University</a> where I earned my PhD.

I'm generally interested in all aspects of system and software security.
Have a look at my <a href="{{ site.resumeurl }}">resume</a> and other interesting <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}resources">resources</a>.
